                Why do we follow the rules? Is it fear of getting caught, the sting of a penalty, or something else entirely?
                A remarkable case from Argentina challenges the usual deterrence story. Sometimes the most powerful laws are the ones with no teeth.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In Argentina, voting has been compulsory for over a century. It is more than a rule on paper. Through a turbulent history
                that included periods of military rule, voting later became a constitutional right, and it carries a strong symbolic meaning
                of democratic belonging.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here is the puzzle. The penalty for not voting is a 50-peso fine. Once worth about $2.50, years of inflation have pushed its real
                value down to around five U.S. cents, and it is rarely collected. From a purely rational perspective, this should have little effect.
                And yet, it does. How can a law with no real punishment still change who shows up to the polls?
              </p>

              <h3>A legal switch flips, and nearly 20% more people show up</h3>
              <p>
                The rules change abruptly at age 18. For 16- and 17-year-olds, voting is optional. The moment a citizen turns 18, voting becomes a
                legal obligation. That single legal switch is followed by a sharp, discontinuous change in behaviour.
              </p>

              <p>
                As soon as Argentinians become legally required to vote, turnout jumps by about 19.7 percentage points. This is not a gradual shift.
                It happens right at the age-18 threshold and is stable across electoral cycles. Nothing else about these young people changes overnight.
                The key change is legal status: a voluntary act becomes a civic duty.

                This document synthesizes findings from a study on Argentina's compulsory voting (CV) laws, which provides causal evidence that symbolic legal penalties—those with minimal and unenforced sanctions—can significantly influence civic behavior.
              </p>

              <p>
                The research leverages a 2012 reform that made voting optional for 16- and 17-year-olds while keeping it mandatory for citizens aged 18 and older. The penalty for abstention is a negligible, unindexed 50-peso fine (worth approximately five U.S. cents in 2023) that is rarely collected.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using a regression discontinuity design and administrative data from 15 national elections (2015–2023), the study identifies the following key takeaways:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Substantial Increase in Turnout: The legal obligation to vote, which begins at age 18, causes an immediate and robust increase in voter turnout of approximately 20 percentage points.</li>
                <li>Mechanism is Expressive, Not Deterrent: The behavioral change is not driven by fear of punishment. Survey data shows that beliefs about enforcement have weak predictive power, and the fine itself is trivial. Instead, the evidence points to expressive compliance: the law functions as a powerful normative signal that activates internalized civic duty.</li>
                <li>Equalizing Effect on Participation: The impact of the symbolic mandate is most pronounced among youth from lower-income and lower-education backgrounds. This suggests that symbolic legal obligations can act as a "leveling device," reducing participation gaps without coercive enforcement.</li>
                <li>Policy Implications: The findings indicate that in low-capacity states, well-established and visible symbolic mandates can be a scalable, low-cost alternative to expensive enforcement regimes for encouraging civic engagement. The law's effectiveness lies not in its coercive power but in its ability to affirm and reinforce widely shared civic norms.</li>
              </ul>

                This document synthesizes an empirical analysis of the economic returns to education in Argentina, based on data from the first quarter of 2022. The central finding is that each additional year of education is associated with an average 8% increase in labor income. This return is complemented by a 3% income increase for each year of work experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, the study reveals a critical paradox: while average years of schooling in Argentina have been steadily increasing, the economic returns to that education have been on a pronounced decline over the last two decades, falling from peaks of over 10% in the mid-2000s.
              </p>

              <p>
                The analysis suggests this trend is driven by several factors, including a potential decline in educational quality, diminishing marginal returns due to a larger supply of educated workers, and the "brain drain" of highly qualified professionals incentivized by low nominal wages (average labor income was below $300 USD in early 2022).

                In many emerging economies, persistent high inflation is a recurring problem. It creates a fog of uncertainty that distorts prices and, as the source paper notes, erodes the predictability needed for sound decision-making—a critical blow to the cornerstone of a functioning economy.
              </p>

              <p>
                To fight this, governments typically reach for one of two toolkits. The first is based on controlling the money supply, and the second relies on managing the exchange rate. The expected outcomes of these plans have been studied for decades.
              </p>

              <p>
                But what if the simple act of a credible announcement could turn their expected outcomes completely upside down?
